        <p>This necessitates the development of searchable encryption techniques. Searchable 
encryption enables authorized users to search for specific keywords within encrypted data 
without compromising its confidentiality [12].<br> It allows users to perform searches on 
encrypted data while keeping the search queries and results hidden from the cloud server. 
Searchable encryption techniques can be categorized into symmetric-key based and public key based approaches, each offering different trade-offs between security and efficiency. In 
this paper, our objective is to propose a methodology for performing keyword search over 
dynamic encrypted cloud data through symmetric-key based verification. We aim to provide 
a secure and efficient solution that allows authorized users to search for specific information 
within encrypted data stored in the cloud.<br> By leveraging symmetric-key based verification, 
we ensure that only authorized users with the appropriate symmetric key can perform 
keyword searches, thereby enhancing data confidentiality [4] .</p>
